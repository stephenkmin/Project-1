# weather-vs-gas-prices
We wanted to take a look at what kind of effect, if any, weather would have on gas prices.
Gas prices for 10 major cities around the US and the average price per month were found online as a csv file.
Then an API we were able to find the temprature for each day in a month depending on the cities that were being used.
We were then able to clean up the data of the weather to find the average temprature in each of the 10 cities based on each month of the year.
We then were able to take the average temprature and the average gas prices and cross reference based on the city and found that there is no conclussive evidence that weather has an effect on gas prices but there is a very small correlation but still not enough to say for sure.
